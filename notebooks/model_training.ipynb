    "\n",
    "1. **General Strategy**\n",
    "The strategy involves estimating the **expected revenue** for each product by leveraging a combination of two models:\n",
    "    1. **Classifier**: Predicts the **probability of a sale** for a product.\n",
    "    2. **Regressor**: Estimates the **revenue generated** from the sale.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Key Detail**\n",
    "    In this approach, the regressor is trained **only on the positive class** (i.e., ignoring instances where no sale  \n",
    "    occurs). This ensures the model focuses solely on predicting revenue for successful transactions, aligning its  \n",
    "    learning objective with the positive outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Why This General Strategy?**\n",
    "This strategy is chosen because the information obtained from training both models together transforms predicted values  \n",
    "into **expected revenue**. However, due to class imbalance, this approach could underestimate revenue. By focusing on  \n",
    "training the regressor to predict revenue directly from the positive class, we aim to achieve better accuracy in revenue  \n",
    "estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Handling Class Imbalance**\n",
    "Addressing class imbalance is critical for robust model performance. Typical methods include:\n",
    "    1. **SMOTE (Oversampling)**: Generates synthetic samples of the minority class.\n",
    "    2. **Downsampling**: Reduces the size of the majority class.\n",
    "    3. **Class Weights**: Adjusts the loss function to account for class imbalance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Chosen Approach**  \n",
    "    We opt to use **class weights** exclusively for the following reasons:\n",
    "        1. **Dataset Size**: The dataset is small, making downsampling impractical.\n",
    "        2. **Avoiding Noise Amplification**:\n",
    "            - SMOTE can propagate noise by generating synthetic samples between distant points (potentially outliers).\n",
    "            - In higher dimensions, the risk of creating irrelevant or noisy data increases.\n",
    "        3. **Simplicity and Robustness**: Class weights provide a straightforward and effective means of handling  \n",
    "            imbalance without introducing synthetic data.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Metrics**\n",
    "    1. Classification\n",
    "    We use **ROC-AUC** as the primary metric for the classifier. This metric evaluates the ability to distinguish  \n",
    "    between positive and negative classes, which is crucial for generating a well-calibrated probability distribution.\n",
    "    1. Regression\n",
    "    We employ **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** to evaluate the regressor, as it is a standard metric for assessing the  \n",
    "    accuracy of continuous predictions, such as revenue estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Selection**\n",
    "Refer to the other notebook for detailed feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hyperparameter Optimization**\n",
    "Hyperparameter tuning was performed for each model individually using Optuna.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Handling Multicollinearity**\n",
    "We addressed multicollinearity by computing various correlation measures and selecting features to minimize high  \n",
    "correlations.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Calibration**\n",
    "Due to time constraints, calibration methods such as isotonic regression or Platt scaling were not implemented but  \n",
    "remain a potential improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Regularization**\n",
    "Tree models, being prone to overfitting, were regularized using parameters such as `max_depth`, `min_samples_split`,  \n",
    "and `min_samples_leaf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Choice**\n",
    "We primarily used Random Forests, as they consistently provided good results. The pipeline supports multiple models,  \n",
    "each capable of accepting its own set of hyperparameters for tuning.\n",
    "\n",
